        <p>
          The ASTROX series will help you take the point to your opponent with devastating smashes and steep attacks.
          Developed for aggressive play, ASTROX racquets are designed to dominate every match.
          It starts with the application of counterbalance theory to racquet design.
          Our Rotational Generator System distributes the weight throughout the grip end,
          frame top and the joint for maximum control, enabling you to transition between shots smoothly, in rapid succession.
          Namd, a graphite that produces more flex and faster snapback, lets ASTROX racquets unleash dramatic power.
          Innovative design like the new Energy Boost Cap maximize Namd’s advantage, giving you more flex on the front of the shaft while helping to stabilize the racquet face on every shot.
          The original ISOMETRIC frame has also evolved into a more ISOMETRIC shape, expanding the sweet spot. Designed for reduced power loss from off-center shots, the 2.9% larger sweet spot increases power.
          Seize the moment on court and overpower the competition with ASTROX series racquets.

            Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRICTM design increases the sweet spot by 7%*. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRICTM racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.

            The iconic ISOMETRIC head shape is enhanced for a larger, more forgiving sweet spot. Frame sides are strategically reinforced with wider areas for a stronger construct.

        <p>
          A world-first, new dimension graphite material, Namd, greatly improves the adhesion of the graphite fibers and resin by attaching nanomaterial directly to the graphite fiber.In high performance racquets, it is common to combine nanomaterials with resin that connects graphite fibers, but in Namd, nanomaterials are directly adhered to the graphite fibers and resin is greatly increased. This major improvement produces a shaft that flexes and redux energy, delivering explosive force on impact with the shuttle.
